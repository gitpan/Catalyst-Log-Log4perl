1.01 Sun Mar  8 23:07:08 GMT 2009
  - Fix test suite to work correctly with Catalyst 5.8 (omega)

1.00 Wed May 30 11:31:58 PDT 2007
  - Added _dump support. (Thanks, jshirley)

    the experimental stuff likely will remain that way.

0.51 Sat Mar 10 11:27:39 PST 2007
  - Put in a dependency for Log::Log4perl.  (thanks, lbr!) That was dumb!

0.50 Fri Mar  9 11:50:49 PST 2007
  - Added support for more Log::Log4perl cspecs.  Sebastian Willert provided
    the code for this, and it was graciously tested by jshirley.  It's use
    should still be considered experimental, as it requires mucking about
    with the internals of Log::Log4perl.
